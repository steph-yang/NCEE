# NCEE

***Dataset***

national data.csv includes national NCEE registration data, national junior-high school enrollment data (JHS), newborn data (not used for analysis, just curious), and NCEE emrollment rate from 1987 to 2018. The dataset is arranged in the order of year of events.

NCEE.csv includes NCEE registration data by province from 1999 to 2018 (most provinces only have data from 2007 and that is the starting year for analysis). The dataset is arranged in the order of year of events.

NCEE_JHS.csv includes JHS enrollment data by province from 1999 to 2017; the data come from National Statistics Yearbook. Notice: the data are overall JHS enrollment, which means it needs to be divided by 3 for cohort data. The dataset is arranged in the order of year of events.

NCEE_reg.csv, same as NCEE.csv, may be deleted later.

Shanghai 2017.csv, Shanghai 2018.csv, Zhejiang 2014.csv, Zhejiang 2017.csv and Zhejiang 2018.csv are score and count data for NCEEs of respective year and province. Notice that Zhejiang adopted staged admission strategy before 2017 and data of 2014 are not normally distributed (somewhat weird though, still useful).
